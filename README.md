Foodwiz is a recipe website dedicated to all culinary arts enthusiasts. Like most recipe sites, the author of foodwiz is himself a very active person, and even gifted without bragging, when it comes to taking the reins in the kitchen. It is his hope that this online platform will establish itself as a meeting place for those who want to share and learn; but more importantly, for the lovers of the kitchen.
